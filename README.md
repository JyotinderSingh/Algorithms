# Problem Solving and Algorithms
### These are my attempts at a few Competitive Programming and Programming Interview questions.
#### Programming Languages: C++ and Python

Most of the questions are from [Elements of Programming Interviews](/EPI) and [LeetCode](/LeetCode).

I've tried to make the solutions as readable as possible using tons of comments and intuitive variable names. Hope this helps people out!
