/*
  Here is a very pure 2D matrix to exemplify our mapping system. each cell has its conceptual
  index if we flattened the 2D matrix into a 1D sorted array.
  [ 0, 1, 2 ]
  [ 3, 4, 5 ]
  [ 6, 7, 8 ]
  totalRows = 3
  totalColumns = 3
  Coordinate Mappings -> (row, col)
  [ (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2) ]
  [ (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2) ]
  [ (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2) ]
  Given a 1D index position .. we declare our mapping equations:
  row in 2D matrix: 1DIndex / totalColumns
  col in 2D matrix: 1DIndex % totalColumns
  Example:
  We want to find the coordinate for element 6.
  row in 2D matrix: (6) / 3 = 2
  col in 2D matrix: (6) % 3 = 0
  
  Output: (2, 0)
  We are correct.
